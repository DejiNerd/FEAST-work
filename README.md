# FEAST-work
Honors thesis

The eigenvalue problem, Ax = /\x, is ubiquitous in Science and Engineering. Many numerical
tools have been developed over the years to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The
FEAST eigenvalue solver belongs to a new generation of techniques that are ideally suited
for large-scale parallel computing. FEAST requires the user to specify a search interval in
the eigenvalue spectrum which may be difficult to know a priori for computing the extreme
eigenvalues. This project proposes a tool for computing the search interval of M extreme
lowest or largest eigenvalues. We employ procedures such as Gershgorinâ€™s circle theorem
and FEAST stochastic techniques in our approach. The resulting search interval which is
obtained at a relatively low cost can be used as an input for FEAST.
